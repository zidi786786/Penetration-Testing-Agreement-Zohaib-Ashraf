# Website-Cloning-SMB-Vulnerability-Scanning

## Ethical Hacking Labs – Website Cloning & SMB Vulnerability Scanning

The purpose of these labs is to understand common attack techniques from an attacker’s perspective in order to improve defensive security practices.

### Ethical Disclaimer

This work is for educational and ethical hacking purposes only.

## Lab 1: Website Cloning (Credential Harvesting)

### Objective
To demonstrate how attackers clone legitimate websites to steal user credentials and how penetration testers simulate this attack to assess security awareness and authentication controls.

### Tools Used
* Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)
* Linux Terminal (Root Access)

### Lab Setup
* Attacker IP: 10.6.6.1
* Target Website: http://dvwa.vm
* Attack Method: Credential Harvester → Site Cloner

### Procedure

1. Switch to Root User
   ```
   sudo su
   ```

2. Launch Social Engineering Toolkit
   ```

   - Site Cloner

4. Configure Website Cloning
   - Enter attacker IP address: 10.6.6.1
   - Enter website URL to clone: http://dvwa.vm

   SET automatically clones the website and hosts it locally.

5. Testing the Cloned Website

   A simple HTML redirect file was created:
   ```html
   <html>
     <head>
       <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=http://10.6.6.1"/>
     </head>
   </html>
   ```

   Opening the file loads the cloned website in a browser.

   **Cloned Site**

   **Real Site**

### Observations
* The cloned website looked identical to the original
* The main visible difference was the URL
* Login credentials entered on the cloned site were captured in the terminal

6. Viewing Harvested Credentials

   Credentials appeared in real time in the terminal.

   To stop and save the output: CTRL + C

### Security Insight
This lab demonstrates how easily users can be deceived by cloned websites and highlights the importance of:

* User security awareness
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Lessons Learned
* Website cloning is simple using social engineering tools
* Visual similarity alone can trick users
* MFA significantly reduces the impact of credential harvesting attacks

## Lab 2: SMB Vulnerability Scanning (Enum4Linux)

### Objective
To enumerate SMB services, users, shares, and configurations in order to identify potential vulnerabilities and information leakage.

### Tools Used
* Enum4Linux
* Nmap
* SMBClient

### Lab Setup

### Findings
* Exposed SMB shares
* Possible anonymous access
* Information leakage about users and system configuration
* These issues could enable unauthorized access or lateral movement if not properly secured.
